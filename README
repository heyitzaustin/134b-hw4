DISCLAIMER:

Although our application may not be fully polished as stated by the requirements,
it is not without good reason. We (CalTrackers) originally had a group of 5 people,
and in the initial stage of the assignment we distributed the work out. Three of
us worked on our parts in the beginning, doing what we can while the other two
put the rest of our team on a communication black out (didn't hear anything from
them for two weeks or so). It turned out that the two of them dropped the class
without letting the rest of us know, meaning we had 40% of the work left in addition
to all the work we still had left, to do in just the last week. This lack of time
for such a huge amount of work ultimately resulted in lack of polish in some aspects
of the application, such as interactive polish and a real time solution.


Now, onto the actual writeup

******************************************************************************




The Purpose of this assignment is to use Javascript to turn a series of HTML
and CSS template mockups to a polished web application. Our responsibilities
were to:

a) Implement CRUD functions (Create Read Update Delete)

b) Have UI focused Javascript

c) Have a notification solution for the end user from the application

For a), we implemented all of the CRUD functions using Firebase, a JavaScript
framework that handles the majority of our backend functionality including
authorization and the database. in the CRUD.js file is a series of javascript
functions called by the HTML that handles all the logic for creating new habits,
listing them, editing them, and deleting them in our database securely.
